AgriSentryAI is a web application designed to empower smallholder farmers in India by providing them with advanced, AI-driven tools for crop protection. It tackles the critical challenges of timely disease diagnosis, resource accessibility, and the growing impact of climate change on agriculture.

## ✨ Key Features

AgriSentryAI integrates several advanced AI capabilities to provide a comprehensive crop protection solution:

*   **📸 Instant AI Disease Diagnosis**: Snap a photo of a diseased plant, and the AI instantly identifies the issue, its confidence level, and provides actionable advice.
*   **🔭 Predictive Pest & Disease Forecasting**: Select your crop, and the AI analyzes local weather data to forecast the risk of specific pest and disease outbreaks, providing a risk score and timeline.
*   **🛍️ Intelligent Treatment Sourcing**: After diagnosis, the app automatically identifies the required remedy (e.g., bio-pesticide, fungicide) and uses an AI tool to locate nearby agro-dealers who stock those products.
*   **🗣️ Multi-Lingual AI Assistant**: A helpful chatbot, fluent in English, Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada, is available to answer any farming-related questions.
*   **☂️ Climate-Linked Insurance Check**: The diagnosis automatically determines if the disease is climate-related and eligible for micro-insurance claims, empowering farmers to seek financial protection.
*   **☀️ Hyper-Local Weather Analysis**: The dashboard displays real-time, localized weather conditions (temperature, humidity, rain forecast) that power the app's AI insights.
