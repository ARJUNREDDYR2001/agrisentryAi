## üö© The Problem

Smallholder farmers face immense pressure from pests, diseases, and unpredictable weather patterns, which can devastate crop yields. Access to timely, accurate information and resources is often limited, leading to significant financial losses and food insecurity. AgriSentryAI bridges this gap with a user-friendly, mobile-first platform that acts as a digital agronomist in the farmer's pocket.

## ‚ú® Key Features

AgriSentryAI integrates several advanced AI capabilities to provide a comprehensive crop protection solution:

*   **üì∏ Instant AI Disease Diagnosis**: Snap a photo of a diseased plant, and the AI instantly identifies the issue, its confidence level, and provides actionable advice.
*   **üî≠ Predictive Pest & Disease Forecasting**: Select your crop, and the AI analyzes local weather data to forecast the risk of specific pest and disease outbreaks, providing a risk score and timeline.
*   **üõçÔ∏è Intelligent Treatment Sourcing**: After diagnosis, the app automatically identifies the required remedy (e.g., bio-pesticide, fungicide) and uses an AI tool to locate nearby agro-dealers who stock those products.
*   **üó£Ô∏è Multi-Lingual AI Assistant**: A helpful chatbot, fluent in English, Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada, is available to answer any farming-related questions.
*   **‚òÇÔ∏è Climate-Linked Insurance Check**: The diagnosis automatically determines if the disease is climate-related and eligible for micro-insurance claims, empowering farmers to seek financial protection.
